Role Name
=========

Installs GlusterFS http://www.gluster.org/ (configures and creates cluster)

Requirements
------------

Any pre-requisites that may not be covered by Ansible itself or the role should be mentioned here. For instance, if the role uses the EC2 module, it may be a good idea to mention in this section that the boto package is required.

Example Playbook

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: glusterfs-nodes
      roles:
         - { role: mrlesmithjr.glusterfs }
